# Dungeon Esc

This is a game which is developed using Unreal Engine 4. In this the player is trapped inside the dungeon and player has to escape out from that dungeon by opening some doors. Doors will only open when the player put some specific object on the given button.

This is a game we made during "BYOG 2022". BYOG is an annual game jam of India named "Build Your Own Game.". In this we have to make a game within 48 hours based on a theme and submit the game on itch platform within given time.

This year we had three themes which are described as :

    Makes Total Sense
    It's Not Supposed To Do That
    It Does Sound Like Me

This game is based on the second theme which is "It's Not Supposed To Do That".

PS : You must have heard of a quote "Never judge a book by its cover". 

But I am telling you, this time you should definitely judge a book by its cover.

Unreal Engine uses pointer for making class instances in order to optimize memory. And also I uploaded only those assets which is used to design the game level.

These things really optimized this game.
